## 📝 Session Checkpoint: 2026-06-03

- **Current SDLC Phase:** Infrastructure / SDLC Tooling Setup (Pre-Development)
- **Active Artifacts:**
  - `AGENTS.md` — Status: ✅ Finalized (Updated with paired Skills mapping)
  - `.opencode/agents/*.md` — Status: ✅ Finalized (All 9 agents refactored to lean persona shells)
  - `.opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Status: ✅ Finalized (All 10 skills created)
- **Achieved Milestones:**
  - Analyzed user's custom SDLC workflow against GitHub Spec Kit; identified and closed gaps (added Clarification and Consistency Check phases)
  - Created 2 new agents: `ClarificationAnalyst.md` and `ArtifactConsistencyChecker.md`
  - Implemented full Separation of Concerns architecture: Agent (Persona/Rules) ↔ Skill (Workflow/Template) for all 9 agents
  - Created 10 skill files total:
    - `product-manager-prd/SKILL.md`
    - `clarification-analyst/SKILL.md`
    - `specification-architect/SKILL.md`
    - `artifact-consistency-checker/SKILL.md`
    - `planner-architect/SKILL.md`
    - `karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md` (Updated to associate with `@GodModeDev`)
    - `expert-code-reviewer/SKILL.md`
    - `bug-remediation-architect/SKILL.md`
    - `diataxis-documentation-architect/SKILL.md`
    - `memory-manager/SKILL.md`
  - Updated `AGENTS.md` Custom Agents Usage section to list paired Skill names for every agent
  - Updated `AGENTS.md` PROGRESS MEMORY TRACKING rule to delegate to `memory-manager` skill
  - Adopted hybrid memory template inspired by Cline Memory Bank and Claude Session Handoff
  - **Ecosystem Synchronization**: Cloned and adapted all Agents, Skills, and Instructions for native support in Google Antigravity (`.agents/`) and GitHub Copilot (`.github/`).
  - Generated GitHub Copilot-specific `.agent.md` files with YAML frontmatter.
- **Dead-Ends (Do NOT Repeat):**
  - None encountered in this session.
- **Updated Files:**
  - `.opencode/agents/*.md` & `.opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md`
  - `.agents/rules/*.md` (Antigravity Agent Personas)
  - `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` (Antigravity Skills)
  - `.agents/instructions/*.md` (Antigravity Global Rules)
  - `.github/agents/*.agent.md` (Copilot Agent Personas)
  - `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` (Copilot Skills)
  - `.github/instructions/*.md` & `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Copilot Global Rules)
  - `AGENTS.md` (Universal rules)
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Architecture: Agent files are "Persona", Skill files are "Procedure"
  - Ecosystem scaling: `.opencode/` acts as the Master Source of Truth, which is mirrored/adapted into `.agents/` and `.github/` to ensure native compatibility across VS Code (Copilot), OpenCode, and Antigravity IDE.
- **Next Action / Pending:**
  - Begin actual product development using the newly established SDLC pipeline (start with PRD phase using `@ProductManagerPRD`)
  - Optionally save this checkpoint to version control (`git commit`)

<!-- checkpoint-tail: Completed full Separation of Concerns refactoring for all 9 SDLC agents + 10 paired skills. Synchronized the entire architecture into .agents/ (Antigravity) and .github/ (Copilot) for cross-platform compatibility. Ready to begin actual product development (PRD Phase). -->
